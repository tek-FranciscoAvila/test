## Introduction
Welcome to the tekchoice-microsite-boilerplate! Provided by TekChoice LLC, this boilerplate serves as a foundational skeleton for building modern web applications using Next.js and other leading technologies. It is designed to enhance developer productivity, code quality, and maintainability.

## Boilerplate Purpose
The rationale behind this boilerplate is to streamline the development process by leveraging the latest tools and best practices. We aim to furnish developers with a robust foundation that promotes scalability and performance in web application development.

## Technologies and Libraries
The boilerplate incorporates several key technologies and libraries:

- **Next.js 14**: Offers server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and improved TypeScript support.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Facilitates rapid UI development with utility-first CSS.
- **MantineDev**: A modern React UI library enhancing usability and accessibility.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages application state with simplified APIs.
- **React Hook Form**: Provides performant form state management with React hooks.
- **TanStack Query**: Simplifies data fetching and caching in React applications.
